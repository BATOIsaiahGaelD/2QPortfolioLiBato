    <h1>The Woodland Mansion</h1>
    <p>
        The Woodland Mansion is a famous structure in Minecraft that can be considered as one of the largest structures in the game. It is primarily made u of spruce wood and its types,
        alongside tons of cobblestone. It is found in biomes like the pale forest and dark forests.  It contains dozens of rooms, some of them being hidden rooms with no entrances 
        all containing secrets and multitudes of loot, ranging from libraries to rooms with diamond blocks. The wodland mansion is also one of the hardest structures to find, often 
        needing a map that you can trade from villagers. It is also one of the hardest structures to raid, as it contains some of the deadliest mobs in the game. It can also spawn regular 
        hostile mobs due to the mansion not having enough light sources to prevent them from spawning. This can add an extra layer of dificulty which may affect you when raiding it.

        Some of the mobs that can be found in this structure include the vindicator, evoker, and the allay. Vexes can also be spawned once an evoker is provoked by a player. Some of these mobs
        espeially the vindicator, can deal tons of damage even with full enchanted armor sets. Vexes are also really dangerous
